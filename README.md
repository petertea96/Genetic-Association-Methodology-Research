# Genetic Association Methodologies Research
This repository is a project comparing the performances of various Kernel-Based Association Studies. It is a culmination of the work I have completed as part of a summer funded research project (funded by NSERC) as well as an undergraduate research project (course code: BIM4920) at the University of Ottawa.
